<h1><strong>NLP</strong></h1>

For the exercise, I utilized the Llama 3 model developed by Olama to construct a Chatbot tailored to assist users in discovering the ideal movie or TV show. The user can select a movie or TV show title from a comprehensive list and pose inquiries to the chatbot. The chatbot leverages a vector database to recommend titles to the user based on similar plot descriptions.
<h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
Design a chatbot to enable TV watchers in searching for a movie or TV show to chat with the assistant about a certain movie or TV show they are interested in with detailed information.
