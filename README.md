<h1><strong>NLP</strong></h1>

For exercise, I used the Llama 3 model from Olama to create a Chatbot which is designed to help the user find the perfect movie or TV show. The user can pick a movie or TV show title from a big list and ask the chatbot questions they might have. The chatbot will use a vector database to find titles for the user that have a similar plot descriptions.
<h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
Design a chatbot to enable TV watchers in searching for a movie or TV show to chat with the assistant about a certain movie or TV show they are interested in with detailed information.
